# Dotfiles
Collection of simple configurations files 

# Philosophy
We're not here to fap our brain on some complicated setup.

The main argument is the simplicity of it, yet it's still elegant.

# Technologies
Theses dotfiles are meant with [sway](https://swaywm.org/) and [wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) in mind.

To use it, you can either pick the conf for specific sofware, or all-in with my sway config.

I use [chezmoi](chezmoi.io) to manage my dotfiles, and advice you to do the same.

# Known issues
- The top bar (waybar) is missing pretty fonts with icons.
- XDG variables aren't set, so some softwares start under xwayland altough they could use wayland.
